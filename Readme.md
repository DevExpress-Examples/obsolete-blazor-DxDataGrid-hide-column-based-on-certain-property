### Blazor Data Grid - How to show/hide columns based on the value from external UI elements

The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component. 

This example illustrates how to change DxDataGrid's column visibility based on the value of external check boxes. 

Bind the Visible property of DataGrid's column and the value of the corresponding check box to the same variable to toggle this column's visibility based on value of this check box.

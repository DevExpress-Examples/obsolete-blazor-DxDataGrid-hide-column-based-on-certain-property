The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component. 

Use the [Column Chooser](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.ShowColumnChooser(System.String)) functionality to implement this feature.
